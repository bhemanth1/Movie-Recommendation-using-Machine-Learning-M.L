# Movie Recommendation System using Machine Learning

We have completed two projects related to movie recommendation systems:

---

## 1. Movie Recommendation System (Hollywood Dataset)

We developed a recommendation system using the **Hollywood Movie Dataset**.  
The system suggests movies based on user preferences and leverages **machine learning techniques** for accurate predictions.

## 2. An Incremental Approach for the Selection of Bias in Recommendation System (Tollywood Dataset)

This project focuses on building a recommendation system for the **Tollywood Movie Dataset** using **Collaborative Filtering** and the **PIP (Proximity, Impact, Popularity)** measure.

### Features
- **Content-Based and Collaborative Filtering Systems**: Implemented to provide personalized recommendations.  
- **PIP Measure**: Enhances recommendation accuracy by considering *proximity, impact, and popularity*.  

### Process Workflow
1. Data Collection using Web Scraping  
2. Data Preparation and Cleaning  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Data Visualizations  
5. Machine Learning Model Application
